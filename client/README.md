## Notes

- This component is out of the scope of the challenge. Therefore, due to the short deadline, it is known that is far from an ideal state (e.g. lack of tests, state management etc).

- The intention here was just to demonstrate a frontend client consuming the challenge's backend system. Please, disconsider this component from the challenge's review.
